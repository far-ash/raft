# RAFT

A **CLI Build System** for **C** written in **Rust**.

> Note: I only created this to learn **Rust**, **Clap**, and **coding** in general.

> Note: It's in the early development stage. So you can't use it _now_... I mean _yet_.

Yeah, I know what you're _thinking_, like _"making a **C** Build System in **Rust**!"_. \
Then I have only one thing to say: _"Who **cares**!"_ or _"Who even **asked**!!!_".
No offence, I really didn't mean it.

## Commands

- ### init

  Initializes the current working directory for working in **C** with **RAFT**.

  ```bash
  $ raft init
  ```

  Or you could give the path to your project

  ```bash
  $ raft init path/to/my/project
  ```

  Creates the following files & directories

  > Note: this could change in the future

  ```plaintext
  hello
  ├── inc
  │  └── main.h
  ├── raft
  │  └── Makefile
  ├── src
  │  └── main.c
  └── Raft.toml
  ```
